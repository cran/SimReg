Description: Functions for performing Bayesian similarity regression,
    and evaluating the probability of association between sets of ontological terms
    and binary response vector. A random model is compared with one in which
    the log odds of a true response is linked to the semantic similarity
    between terms and a latent characteristic ontological profile.
